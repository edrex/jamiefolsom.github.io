## This is a test post, created through prose.io

[GH pages](http://pages.github.com "Github Pages") regenerates the site from a repo every time it's updated with new content.

Actually, it **takes a few minutes** before it's updated. Not sure what the delay is about.

That shouldn't matter for a writing project, as the commits all seem to get saved.
